2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Configure the environment variables.
    - The ENC_KEY should be 32 random bytes in hexadecimal format (`64 * [a-z0-9]`).
        - `node -p "crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')"`
4. Generate an rsa keypair for JWT signing.
    - Run `mkdir certificates`
    - Run `openssl genrsa -out certificates/key.pem 4096`
    - Run `openssl rsa -in certificates/key.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out certificates/public.pem`
5. Seed the database by running `npm run prepare-database`.
6. Build the source code by running `npm run build`
6. Run the server by running `npm start`.
7. By first time setup you can call the `initializeAdmin` function in the admin controller. The request accepts: ```JSON {"firstName":"<firstname>", "lastName": "<lastname>", "username": "<admin username>", "email": "<working email>" }```
